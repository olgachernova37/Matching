 * Escrow state machine. Pure: no storage, no clock beyond the `now` passed in.

 * Money only ever leaves escrow through `release` (to the provider's bound
 * address) or `refund` (back to the buyer), and both are terminal — a deal
 * can be paid out at most once. A release is accepted only after the work was
 * delivered: paid and delivered are separate facts, never assumed from each
 * other (an idea credited to SingIt — see HACKATHON.md).
