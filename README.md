# Human-Gated AI Copilot

**An AI agent that reads live on-chain evidence, proposes actions — and cannot spend a cent until a
real human approves that exact action with a World ID Selfie Check.**

## The problem

Agentic apps verify a human **once, at login**, then let the agent act freely for the rest of the
session. Everything after that login is unattested: a prompt-injected or simply confused agent
spends with the human's authority long after the human stopped watching.

## The idea: bind the proof to the action, not the session

The World ID **`signal`** is set to **`keccak256(canonicalJson(action.payload))`**. The proof is not a
login — it is a **per-action approval receipt**. Change one byte of what the agent proposed and the
receipt stops validating, server-side.

```
 you ──▶ agent ──1──▶ The Graph (live subgraph)  ──▶ wallet evidence
                └──2──▶ risk engine (deterministic) ──▶ score + cited reasons
                └──3──▶ propose action, hash the exact payload
                         │
      risk ≥ 50 or cost > 0 ──▶ 4. Selfie Check, signal = keccak256(payload)
                         │        (QR on desktop → World App → liveness + face)
                         ▼
                 5. server verifies the proof, re-deriving the hash itself
                         │            ──▶ HumanGateReceipt (single-action, 5 min)
                         ▼
                 6. x402 payment runs only against a valid, matching receipt
```

## How each sponsor is load-bearing

| Sponsor | Role | Why it is not decorative |
|---|---|---|
| **The Graph** | 👁 the eyes | Live Uniswap V3 mainnet swaps drive the **deterministic risk score**, which decides *whether a human is pulled in at all*. No data → no decision. `src/lib/graph/` |
| **World** | ✋ the gate | Selfie Check proof bound to the action payload. Also our **continuity** signal: the `nullifierHash` ledger distinguishes a returning human from a new one. `src/lib/worldid/` |
| **Bazantic** | 🤖 the hands | Our x402/MPP gateway (**EchoBrief**) exposes the human gate as a paid, agent-callable service; execution settles USDC on Base. `src/lib/bazantic/`, [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) |

### The three signals we claim (World track vocabulary)
- **Abuse prevention** — an autonomous agent cannot spend without a fresh human proof bound to that exact payload.
- **Risk** — the gate is *risk-triggered, not blanket*: `requiresHuman = riskScore >= 50 || costUsd > 0`, from live Graph data. Low-risk reads stay frictionless, which is the argument for a low-friction, medium-assurance credential.
- **Continuity** — Selfie Check's 90-day validity confirms a returning user is the same person; the receipt trail shows "returning human · first approved N days ago".

**Assurance, stated honestly:** Selfie Check is **medium-assurance** and explicitly **not**
one-person-one-account. We claim it *raises the cost of automated and repeated abuse*. It is not
sybil-proof, and we never say it is.

## What is genuinely live

- **The Graph:** Gateway GraphQL against Uniswap V3 mainnet `5zvR82QoaXYFyDEKLZ9t6v9adgnptxYpKpSbxtgVENFV`, plus the **Subgraph MCP** (`subgraphs.mcp.thegraph.com/sse`) for agent-driven discovery. Every result carries `source.subgraphId` + `queriedAt`, rendered as the console's **LIVE** badge. **No mocked data in the shipped path** — a mock path exists for offline dev only and forces a bright "MOCK DATA" banner.
- **World ID:** RP context signed server-side with World's official `signRequest`; proofs verified at `developer.world.org/api/v4/verify/{rp_id}`, always against **our** `rp_id`.
- **Bazantic:** EchoBrief gateway live, MCP server exposing our tools; x402 payments in USDC on Base.

## Security properties (each with a test)

| Property | Where | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Proof bound to the exact payload | `src/lib/worldid/hash.ts` | one byte changed ⇒ receipt invalid |
| Canonicalisation is unambiguous | same | key order/whitespace can't change the hash; `NaN`, `-0`, `undefined`, BigInt, Dates rejected |
| Receipts are single-use | `src/lib/worldid/receipt.ts` | 8 concurrent validations, exactly 1 wins |
| The gate cannot fail open | `src/lib/agent/execute.ts` | invalid receipt is refused *before* any payment step |
| Only our relying party | `src/app/api/worldid/verify/route.ts` | a foreign `rp_id` is rejected |
| The agent cannot self-approve | `src/lib/agent/tools.ts` | `propose_action` has no path to execution |
| Risk isn't the model's opinion | `src/lib/agent/tools.ts` | score recomputed server-side from Graph data |
| No unbacked claims | `src/lib/agent/plan.ts` | a "prepared" claim without an action is corrected server-side |

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olgachernova37/Matching && cd Matching
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # then fill in the values described in that file
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

Minimum to see live Graph data and the agent: `GRAPH_API_KEY` (Subgraph Studio) and
`GEMINI_API_KEY`. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_APP_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_ACTION`, `WLD_RP_ID` and
`WLD_RP_PRIVATE_KEY` for approvals; `BAZANTIC_GATEWAY_URL`, `BAZANTIC_RECIPE_ENDPOINT` and
`X402_PRIVATE_KEY` for paid execution. Storage uses local files in dev and Redis when
`*_REST_API_URL`/`_TOKEN` are present (required on Vercel, whose filesystem is read-only).

```bash
npm run graph:smoke -- 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045   # live Graph proof
node --test src/lib/**/*.test.ts                                    # 23 tests
```

## Try the gateway as an agent would

```bash
curl -X POST https://echobrief.online/api/gateway/gate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"address":"0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045","intent":"Send 1 ETH"}'
# → { riskScore, riskReasons, requiresHuman, actionHash, approvalUrl }
curl "https://echobrief.online/api/gateway/gate?actionId=<id>"
# → { "status": "awaiting_human" } until a human passes Selfie Check
```

An external agent can **prepare** an action. It can never **approve** one.
