# World ID / Selfie Check friction log

Append as it happens (T3 owns this). T7 turns it into the graded FEEDBACK.md.

## Docs / Developer Portal

- Tried `node --test src/lib/worldid/*.test.ts` with Next path aliases -> expected the built-in runner to resolve the same imports as Next -> Node does not understand `@/lib` aliases and fails before running those tests -> exact error: `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@/lib' imported from /workspaces/matching-t3/src/lib/worldid/continuity.ts`.
- Tried to use the IDKit proof result as a top-level signal/nullifier -> expected the response shape to mirror the request -> the installed SDK declarations put both values inside `responses[]` as `signal_hash` and `nullifier`; the Selfie Check preset is documented as preview-only and says to contact World for enablement -> exact SDK note: `Preview: Selfie Check is currently in preview. Contact us if you need it enabled.`

### Integration (logged at merge, 2026-09-11)

- **Access gating contradicts itself.** credentials/11 says Selfie Check is feature-flagged and to email developers@toolsforhumanity.com to enable it; the SDK says "Contact us if you need it enabled". We emailed (no reply after hours) and asked in the ETHGlobal Discord, where the World team answered that **no access is needed for Selfie Check**. -> A hackathon team loses hours to an email gate that apparently doesn't exist. Suggest: state the real status on credentials/11 (and in the SDK note), or show the flag state per app in the Developer Portal.
- **`signal_hash` is not the signal.** Compared `responses[0].signal_hash` to the signal we passed (our `keccak256` action hash) -> expected equality, since the field is named after the signal -> it is `hashSignal(signal)`, a field-element hash, so the raw comparison could never match and every genuine proof would have been rejected -> found only by reading `idkit-core` type declarations (`ResponseItemV4.signal_hash`) and exporting `hashSignal`. Suggest: a one-line doc note next to the response shape, e.g. "compare against `hashSignal(yourSignal)`".
- **RP signature format is easy to get wrong.** The first implementation EIP-191-signed `JSON.stringify(rpContext)`. The real message is binary: `version || nonce(32) || createdAt_u64_be || expiresAt_u64_be || action(32)`, with a specially derived nonce. Nothing fails loudly at build time — the World App would just reject the request. `@worldcoin/idkit-server`'s `signRequest` does it correctly, but we found it by listing `node_modules`, not from the React integration guide. Suggest: link `signRequest` directly from the React/JS setup pages where the RP signature is first mentioned.
- **Sandbox app access: self-serve, but documented as if it were not.** sandbox/testing-selfie-check says "Feature access requires enablement through your World point of contact before testing begins", and credentials/11 points at an email. The actual path is self-serve: Developer Portal -> "World ID Sandbox" -> Android tab -> submit the Google Account email (iOS: Apple Account email, via TestFlight). Requested Android access 2026-09-11 ~23:00 CEST; approval is not instant, so it cannot be done the morning of a demo. Suggest: put the self-serve Portal path first on testing-selfie-check, with the expected approval time.
- **Get Prices API rejects callers its docs say it accepts.** docs `api-reference/developer-portal/get-prices` lists `GET https://app-backend.toolsforhumanity.com/public/v1/miniapps/prices` with `security: []` and no required headers. Called it with `?cryptoCurrencies=WLD,USDC&fiatCurrencies=USD` (and ETH) -> expected prices -> every call returns `{"allowRetry":false,"error":{"success":false,"code":"AU-001","message":"App update required"}}`, on both `app-backend.toolsforhumanity.com` and `app-backend.worldcoin.dev`, with or without `client-version` / `x-app-version` / `app-version` / World App `User-Agent` headers (2026-09-11 ~23:50 CEST). We wanted it as the sponsor price feed in our Bazantic recipe and had to drop it. Suggest: document the header AU-001 expects, or state that the endpoint is World-App-only.
- **Where the RP signing key lives is undocumented.** docs/idkit/signatures says to "obtain the signing_key from the Developer Portal" but not where in the Portal, whether it is shown only once, or how to rotate it.
